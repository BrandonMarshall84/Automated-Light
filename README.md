<h1>Automated Light</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Develop a smart home automation and security system by designing the prototype in Tinkercad, building the hardware with the components from the IoT Tech Core Kit and programming within Arduino IDE. The smart home system will encompass various devices to monitor the condition of the home. This includes a door sensor to check whether to door is open or closed, a distance sensor to monitor for a possible home intruder which were completed in the previous projects and last i will complete an automated lights that turns on when it is dark.
